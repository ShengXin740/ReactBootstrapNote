## Installation

```
npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap
```

Don't forget to import the css file

```
{
  /* The following line can be included in your src/index.js or App.js file */
}
import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';
```

There are other ways, such as yarn or CDN. You can check the [docs](https://react-bootstrap.netlify.app/docs/getting-started/introduction).

```
npx create-react-app app_name
```

This is to create a new react app. The app name can no longer contain Capital letters.
